I am starting the new year with this blog. I am exploring the [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org) using the [Hugo Framework](https://gohugo.io/) as a static site generator and the \[Netlify Platform] (https://www.netlify.com/) to host and deploy my website. I'll keep exploring these technologies and hopefully write more about my findings. Stay tuned!
